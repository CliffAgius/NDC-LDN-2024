# .NET on tiny IoT Meadow Boards

All the files and projects from my talk at NDC London 2024 about using C# on Meadow IoT boards.  

## Getting Meadow Boards

You can get the Meadow boards I used direct from Wilderness Labs:

Store - [https://store.wildernesslabs.co](https://store.wildernesslabs.co/)

Docs - [http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Getting_Started/](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Getting_Started/)

for setting up your new board the instructions on the Getting started sometimes causes issues, so use this blog post instead as it's the most stable way to set-up a new board.

## Robot Arm

The robot arm files can be used to print your very own robot to move around. This is best printed in PLA and you just need 4off SG90 servo's like these - [SG90 Servo](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ARCELI-Airplane-Accessories-Arduino-Helicopter/dp/B07MY2Y253/ref=sr_1_5?crid=18GVRGA7DRGY8&keywords=sg90&qid=1652171728&sprefix=sg90%2Caps%2C97&sr=8-5)

`The Robot arm design is a simplified version of this project from Thingyverse to enable quicker and simpler print and build - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1684471 ` as modified by my son Macaulay.

If you want to know how to build the Robot arm to my other son shows how it's done here on YouTube - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk84dhThmjY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk84dhThmjY)


# Set-up Azure IoT Hub

The docs are here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/?WT.mc_id=IoT-MVP-5003764](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/?WT.mc_id=IoT-MVP-5003764)

and I have a blog post here that explains it for the ESP32 and NanoFramework but the process is almost identical - [https://www.cliffordagius.co.uk/post/connectesp32toiothub/](https://www.cliffordagius.co.uk/post/connectesp32toiothub/)


## Feedback

As with any of my talks I am just sharing what I have learnt playing with the tech and being human just like you I make mistakes, so if you spot one or want to share your thoughts please reach out and lets learnt together.

Hope you enjoy

Happy Coding.
